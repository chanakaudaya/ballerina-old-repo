# Hello, I'm Ballerina.

Ballerina is a new programming language for integration built on a sequence diagram metaphor. Ballerina is:
- Simple
- Intuitive
- Visual
- Powerful
- Lightweight
- Cloud Native
- Container Native
- Fun

The conceptual model of Ballerina is that of a sequence diagram. Each participant in the integration gets its own lifeline and Ballerina defines a complete syntax and semantics for how the sequence diagram works and execute the desired integration.

Ballerina is not designed to be a general purpose language. Instead you should use Ballerina if you need to integrate a collection of network connected systems such as HTTP endpoints, Web APIs, JMS services, and databases. The result of the integration can either be just that - the integration that runs once or repeatedly on a schedule, or a reusable HTTP service that others can run.
